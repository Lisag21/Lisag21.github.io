        <p class="p">My name is Lisa Galpin and I have two boys at home, ages 3 and 5. My husband and I live in Dunlap where our oldest attends school. I grew up in Brimfield, where I graduated high school and then attended Bradley University from which I acquired my Secondary Education bachelor degree with a concentration in Family and Consumer Sciences in 2011.<br/>I have been teaching Family and Consumer Sciences at the High School level for 10 years. The main subjects that I cover are Child Development, Parenting, Food Science 1 and 2, Preschool Laboratory, Early Childhood Education, and an Introductory course to FCS. I am currently pursuing my masters in the School of Information Science and Learning Technologies through the University of Missouri-Columbia with an emphasis in Online Education with a completion date of 2024-2025.</p>
