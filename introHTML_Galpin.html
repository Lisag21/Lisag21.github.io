<title>Welcome to Lisa Galpin's Website</title>

<body>
My name is Lisa Galpin and I have two boys at home, ages 3 and 5. I have been teaching Family and Consumer Sciences at the High School level for 10 years. The main subjects that I cover are Child Development, Parenting, Food Science 1 and 2, Preschool Laboratory, Early Childhood Education, and Introductory course to FCS. I have no web application or development training or experience so I am hoping to gain a lot of information throughout my graduate coursework. I would like to be able to feel comfortable exploring the unknown technology options that are out there as well as implement more into my classroom setting. Having a short period where classes were 100% virtual based during the pandemic, I realized how much more you are able to get students involved if you are implementing technology. In my free time, I love to be outside, swimming, and live on the beach if I was able to afford it.
