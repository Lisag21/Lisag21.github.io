<title>Welcome to Lisa Galpin's Website</title>

<body>
My name is Lisa Galpin and I have two boys at home, ages 3 and 5. I have been teaching Family and Consumer Sciences at the High School level for 10 years. The main subjects that I cover are Child Development, Parenting, Food Science 1 and 2, Preschool Laboratory, Early Childhood Education, and an Introductory course to FCS. I have no web application or development training, so I am hoping to gain a lot of skills throughout my graduate coursework. I would like to feel comfortable exploring the unknown technology options that are out there as well as implement more into my classroom setting. During this crazy past school year, and teaching classes 100% virtual based during the pandemic, different technology platforms played a major role in keeping my students engaged. In my free time, I love to be outside, swimming, visiting as many beaches as possible, and spending time with my boys.
