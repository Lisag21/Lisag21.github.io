        My experience with children began when I was young, my siblings are all 5 to 15 years older than me. I became an aunt when I was 6, and have spent many days and a lot of time with them. During that time, I would play with them and then as I grew older, I would watch them and help them with school work. This sparked my love for the focus on early childhood. Realizing this, I pursued a bachelor's degree through Bradley University with a major in Secondary Education concentration in Family and Consumer Sciences. Prior to graduation in May of 2011, I completed my student teaching at Washington High School in Illinois, where I supervised a preschool laboratory and taught child development. Following graduation, I taught at Dee-Mack High School in Mackinaw, Illinois where I taught Child Development, Parenting, Positive Life Attitudes, and an overview course of Family and Consumer Sciences. After 2 years of teaching I found a job closer to home, Metamora Township High School in Metamora, Illinois where I am teaching 8 years later.</p> 
     <p id=p style="color:#F6E4EC">
        This brings me to today, where I am currently attending the School of Information Science and Learning Technologies with an emphasis in Online Education through the University of Missouri-Columbia virtually. With more experience in technology, I am hoping to incorporate a variety of platforms in my classroom so that I continue to grow as an educator for those students near and far. As an educator, how can I say how important school is to my students unless I am demonstrating this myself. It is important to me to practice what I preach, and to continue to grow myself mentally so that I can continue to teach the current information as well as make it applicable and relevant to all my students.</p>
        <p id=p style="color:#F6E4EC">
        Throughout the semester, it is my goal for students to become comfortable in situations that they may not otherwise feel comfortable in. Life is not always about being comfortable in what you do, but <em>pushing</em> yourself in uncomfortable situations so that you can learn and grow. Through my own experience, this is how I grew the most in life. I was born different then most everyone else, I have one arm that is amputated at the left elbow. I grew up constantly uncomfortable, and feared public speaking but I wanted to be a teacher. To do this, I pushed myself through all situations that I would normally avoid. It took years and even now, I will still get butterflies before introducing myself to a new group of students. I have found that if I am comfortable with myself then others around you will soon not notice anything different about you. I hope that by putting myself out there, and accepting my own differences, I am helping others to love themselves the way they are and to feel comfortable in their own skin. </p>

    
<h2 style="color: #eaaee8">Teaching Philosophy</h2>

<p id=p p style="color:#F6E4EC">
    This would be my top teaching philosophy, that you gain the most growth when you push yourself in situations in which you would normally not be comfortable in. When you find that you are comfortable, chances are you are static and not pushing yourself to grow mentally or physically. When students sign up for my class, I always preface it by saying that there are a lot of presentations and scenarios in which they may feel silly or uncomfortable (reading stories for example). I have had many students tell me that they were nervous at the beginning of my class but given my constant encouragement and the comfortable atmosphere I provided, they had grown comfortable with what they used to fear.
