  <h2 id="#Artifact1">Competency 1: Design Learning Environment</h2>  
 
  <p class="p">Within my classroom I use lesson plan forms that students have to use to plan their preschool lesson. The preschool laboratory class (Child Care Services), where I teach and supervise high school students teaching preschool aged children. The high school students are required to fill out a lesson plan for each of the curriculum areas that they are responsible for covering that day: read an age appropriate book, focused learning activity on either math, science, social studies, or fine motor skills, art activity, and a closing game. They use resources that they have been given to properly fill out the objectives, goals, description, etc. and are required to turn these into me in advance of their teaching date. This ensures that the students are meeting all of the standards that are set in place for the preschool learning environment as well as teaching the high school students how to prepare, plan and instruct at this age level. 
      </p>
 
  <p style="color:#F4A9CB;"><font-family: sans;> Reflection: This has been a great tool in my class, it has allowed me to give feedback to the high school students on where they need to improve and prepare more as well as to be able to provide the preschool families a daily guideline of activities for each day so that if they want to, they can reinforce these at home.

<h2 id="#Artifact2">Competency 2: Improve workplace performance</h2>  
 
<p class="p">As a teacher, I have learned that self-reflection is one of the biggest tools that is always valuable. With this in mind, I created a self-reflection form that the high school students are responsible for completing immediately after they have finished teaching that daysâ€™ lesson. It is not a graded artifact but more so just checking that they are thoroughly reflecting on each part of their lesson, what they feel went well, what they feel they could have improved upon, and most importantly what are they going to implement next time they teach to improve. We all have strengths and weaknesses, the main part is learning what they are and striving for better so that everyone around us is receiving the best we are capable of giving them. This also gives me a chance to give them candid feedback on areas that need improvement.
</p>
<p style="color:#F4A9CB;"><font-family: sans;>
  Reflection: I love this tool in my classroom, in every job we are all evaluated in some form so this helps to set them up to be comfortable with evaluation as well as to start reflecting on improvements that they can make within themselves. Surprisingly, a lot of the time the students are harder on themselves and pushing themselves to strive for more each time. This has been a great tool in teaching them self-reflection.
