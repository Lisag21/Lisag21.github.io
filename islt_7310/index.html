<main><h6>My name is Lisa Galpin and I have two boys at home, ages 3 and 5. I have been teaching Family and Consumer Sciences at the High School level for 10 years. The main subjects that I cover are Child Development, Parenting, Food Science 1 and 2, Preschool Laboratory, Early Childhood Education, and an Introductory course to FCS. I have no web application or development training, so I am hoping to gain a lot of skills throughout my graduate coursework. I would like to feel comfortable exploring the unknown technology options that are out there as well as implement more into my classroom setting. During this crazy past school year, and teaching classes 100% virtual based during the pandemic, different technology platforms played a major role in keeping my students engaged. In my free time, I love to be outside, swimming, visiting as many beaches as possible, and spending time with my boys.</h6>
    <p>Welcome to Family and Consumer Sciences with Mrs. Lisa Galpin! Where we focus on the total development of each child. In all of the child development focus courses of FCS our goal is to understand the total development of the child ages 3-5 covering the physical, intellectual, emotional, and social areas. While also focusing on the younger ages of development, the high school students can expect to learn transferable employability skills in school, community, and workplace settings. The projects you will see are based in the Child Care Services course that is offered at MTHS. While teaching the preschool, MTHS students will receive hands-on career experience within early childhood, education, and related services. The students are responsible for analyzing developmentally appropriate practices to plan for early childhood, education, and related services under my supervision. This website will help you to understand the expectations of the course, and what it looks like in action.</p>
